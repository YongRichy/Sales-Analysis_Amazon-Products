## 🏷 What is an SKU?

SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) is a unique identifier used by retailers to track inventory. It helps to differentiate products based on attributes like size, color, brand, and type. 

For example: 
- **SanDisk 1TB SSD** and **SanDisk 2TB SSD** will have different SKUs.
- Even if two products are in the same category, their SKUs allow precise tracking of sales and reviews.
